__label__2,Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this no matter black white young old male female EVERYBODY says one thing "Who was that singing ?"
__label__2,One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.
__label__1,Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However after about a year the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
__label__2,works fine but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.
__label__2,Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.
__label__1,DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.
__label__1,Incorrect Disc: I love the style of this but after a couple years the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
__label__1,DVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features no language select nothing just play.
__label__2,Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. "Dr Shen Fu" a Weird Tales magazine reprint is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.
__label__2,Great book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries colour pictures and is a nice starter for before you go and once you are there.
__label__1,Not!: If you want to listen to El Duke then it is better if you have access to his showerthis is not him it is a gimmickvery well orchestrated.
__label__2,TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.
__label__1,didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.
__label__1,Don't buy!: First of all the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry but they don't actually have any of these items and if I received an email telling me it has shipped it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!
__label__2,Simple Durable Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
__label__2,Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99 this PC game is WELL worth it great graphics colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade.
__label__2,SOY UN APASIONADO DEL BOX: Y ESTE LIBRO ESTÁ ESPLÉNDIDO !Lo disfrutas lo puedes usar como obra de consultaNos trae LAS HISTORIA DE LOS BOXEADORES MÁS BRILLANTES DE LOS CAMPEONES DURANTE CIEN AÑOS !!Si te gusta el box...¡NO TE LO PIERDAS !
__label__2,Some of the best fiddle playing I have heard in a long time: This is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing. Ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person. You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
__label__1,Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation it was very boring all through out the book
__label__1,Dont like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and havent worn then. I wouldnt buy this product again. Dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
__label__2,one of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
__label__2,Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD: I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its smalllight and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation.
__label__1,Waste of money!: Like many of the Barbie CD Roms the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done.
__label__2,works great: i bought this item to connect to a strobe light. unit functions well. not sure that it has all the range claimed but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this. just too many variables. I can say it works from my neighbors house into my garage; at least 40' going thru two buildings. now if i make too much noise later at night he can simply press a button to let me know.
__label__1,Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device lamp etc. plugged into this control it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.
__label__2,wish i had gotten this sooner!: ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off. ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly. added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want. under my desk shelf etc.
__label__1,Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.
__label__2,This is the all time best book!: This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.
__label__2,Mary Ash: Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
__label__2,Tha BOMB of a book!!: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like AshQuinnJuliunDamonGabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for lifelike I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!
__label__2,This book was a great book that i have read many times!: This book was so great! I loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart. I just hope that there is a follow up on this story because I want to know if Mary-Lynette and Ash get together.
__label__2,They'd watch it nonstop if I'd let them: apart from it arriving broken the first time my kids are loving this DVD which I alternate with the other I purchased to keep my own sanity. This DVD has created a Thomas fan out of my 3 1/2 yr. old daughter as well.
__label__1,Not as expected...: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!
__label__2,Wonderful: I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants. The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores. I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length. The delivery was quick (especially during Christmas) and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
__label__1,Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again.
__label__2,Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do but read. Mind you reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance which I am both fond of it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.
__label__2,WeiB FOREVER!: This is a great CD!! I love WeiB Kreuz!! The anime is awsome! Its bout 4 guys (hhhooottt) who work at a flower shop but at night they are the White Hunters (or Byce as in the anime) they are assasins that "hunt the tomorrow" of Bad guys the bad guys the police cant get . Like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason... from a strange gas substance that w/ instant contact ingulfs any object... but i couldnt resist. Its also an emotional anime at times! I think this is a Cd and Anime any anime fan should see...
__label__1,Great Book--unacceptable condition: I was looking forward to receiving this book as I was going to New Orleans to Antoine's restaurant. I read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy. This book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that I could not read it without my eyes watering. I sent it back at my own expense and to date I have not had a refund.
__label__2,Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI CSS etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.
__label__2,Marriage has its good and bad moments: This is a tear-jerker mixed with humor. A lot of rough patches for this couple but don't let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too. I watch this movie often as I am a hopeless romantic and I thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix) plus it's worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts. It ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but that's not exactly a bad thing in this case. I recommend it to everyone.
__label__2,Amazing...: love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
__label__1,More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the "dark" series you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!
__label__1,Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.
__label__2,Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader: I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them get close to them and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.
__label__2,Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always "one against the world" Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay Marino and Benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.
__label__2,Great Beginning...poor ending: Parricia Corwell Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning! Her relation to her family her dedication to her work exeptional. However this story began to get boring towards the end...the ending not too great.
__label__1,12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make....: Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell I have heard many more clever jokes and "one-liners" watching King of Queens on cable.....SERIOUSLY FOLKS it's THAT BAD....the bad jokes and the 23 references to small jewish penises got old real quick. Thought i would always be a Sandler fan but he clearly Adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and RAN!Why else would the plot line include Seth Rogan writing for him??? To put things into perspective this film made Bruno look like Casablanca!!
__label__1,I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.: I should have known going into this movie having Judd Apatow a part of it would mean I would hate it. However having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude "jokes". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.
__label__2,No another grill like this...: This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....
__label__2,From Potter's Field by Patricia Cornwell.: This was a very good book with excellent descriptions. It's a real page turner and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. The best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
__label__2,An Engrossing and Chilling Read: My first foray into the novels of Patricia Cornwell has left me impressed. The characters were intense and realistic. My only concern is that the "evil" Temple Gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning. Why did he decide to trail and give "gifts" to Dr. Scarpetta? Needless to say I will be reading more of Cornwell's books especially if they are at all like this novel.
__label__2,great book. i loved it! they mentioned a movie where is it?: the publisher said soon to be a movie. does anyone know if a movie was ever created?
__label__2,Simply Awesome!: This was only my first Cornwell novel and I'm hooked! In the past few months I have managed to collect all of her books and I can't wait to dive into them! This summer will be a suspensful one for Scarpetta and I.
__label__1,Predictable & has a lame ending: I have read all of the Scarpetta novels & this is not the worst (that would be Cause of Death) but rt. up there. I thought the story began well enough but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.
__label__2,Black Knight C2C Heat Squash Racquet: Great racquet! But I'm a power hitter I have no power Generating Difficulty With This racquet. My style is to try to volleyball and everything I've found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered. I like the factory grip although with distinct ridges Others prefer a smooth grip May - give the factory grip on chance and you May Come to like it. The "sale" prices are right for a high About end racquet racquets and Black Knight in Have a reputation for overall durability so you Should get plenty of use Before replacement. Note: I got my first C2C as a D level player and did not like it Immediately. Howeve as my game improved version I switched from my Bandit Black Knight C2C White racquet to the great success and Have HAD. So It Might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players But Will Benefit From this fine racquet.
__label__1,A historical gem whose title obscures its intent: Started laughing in the second chapter....enjoyed the book after I realized that I wasn't going to learn anything new. It's obviously a miracle that we survived for the 65 years since it was first published.And seeing that the pending insolvency of the US was as loudly shouted in the 40's as it is now was worth the price. This book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the US.Kudos to whoever owns the copyright --- now there's economics in action.
__label__1,Vastly overrated work of fiction: I was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery. Sure back then there was no Google searching nor number crunching laptops. But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians tea-baggers & Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence. I would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty & irrational.
__label__2,sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band: edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky secludedisolating tunes. i envision a ironical pace. i thought she was from chicago millions and millions of people and she sings stark loneliness
__label__2,Great Camera: I recently purchased this camera and I'm very satisfied with it. I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital. It is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use. I highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price. Nice going Sony!
__label__1,Had to return it: The sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right. I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over. Squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage. If you do decide to purchase this product it's easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.
__label__1,Broke the 2nd time I wore it great until then: I think this product provided a great fit. I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.
__label__2,The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture you eat much less since it squeezes the he'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.
__label__2,Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy.
__label__2,I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6 I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.
__label__1,WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it.
__label__1,CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off I felt sore around my sides and my back I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!
__label__1,Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum. I'm ten weeks post-pardum and may try it again but it was a real self-esteem crusher initially. I'm a size 0 pre-pregnancy and so I thought it was fair to order the XS but I guess not.
__label__1,nice product: My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
__label__2,Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well nothing is perfect.
__label__1,Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development movie-like dialogue and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger don't waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you'll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don't expect to have any appetite left.
__label__1,1 and thats being generous....: I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read"To Tess who thinks it's about time"Author I think she may mean something else....
__label__2,Good matt nude lipstick: It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
__label__2,I would sell it -- book complete with dust cover. Excellent: West is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work. He has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
__label__2,A welcomed change from the frozen plains of Europe: A refreshing sunwarmed beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of Ice Age Europe. A delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive. The plot line moves in different ways from other "Woman against the odds" novels so it is a fresh and not predictable. A very good read and a much better choice over Jean Auel's "Shelters of Stone".
__label__1,where does the Novel begin?: I found it preachy and long and got.very bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologue.Then tried to find the.actual novelFinally gave up!!!
__label__1,Avoid it.: The abridged version of this book would read as so:"Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong."There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language stupid storyline quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it.
__label__1,ok...: this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
__label__2,The Scarlet Letter: I really enjoyed this book. It shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake. Can't go wrong with the classics.
__label__2,Creepy: The creepiest book I've ever read! It's a creepy mystery/romance all in one creepy book! I would read it again lol
__label__1,A book for those with time on their hands: If this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars? Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book but one with a limited audience. Don't read it unless you don't mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose. Personally I like an author who gets to the point.
__label__1,Painful: This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call "classics". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?
__label__2,Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans.
__label__1,Horrible reader: i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
__label__1,Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor he told me to email him to remind him to fix it but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.
__label__2,The "Scarlet" Letter: Much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.
__label__2,The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser  the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American.
__label__2,This book is Great!: One might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors. Although I respect those who disliked The Scarlet Letter I disagree. It's no wonder that people that don't know how to capitalize the word 'I'. I thought that this book was wonderful if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.
__label__1,I had to read it...: I had to read this book for school. I did not like it. I'm not sure what the point is of this story; several people hae told me what they think it is but I dont agree and they dont agree with each other.
__label__2,Possibly the funniest movie ever made.: It starts off a bit slow but once the product placement jokes start it takes off.
__label__1,same problems as munchkin version: Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap flimsy leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin
__label__2,Sassy Baby Warming Dish. Interesting concept.: We tried the Baby warming dish. We found that for our 1 year old it was pretty small and didn't really hold enough water to keep her warm.I think it would work ok for an infant although I think a blanket would work just as well.Recommendation:Buy********************HoldSell
__label__1,Unreadable!: As good as this book may be the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate.
__label__1,Used for circuits project: I used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose. I would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if you're worried about the environment.
__label__1,Two Tedious Hours: The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
__label__1,one of the worst movies of 2002: god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz Rob Schneider and others contribute voices.
__label__2,Fantastic: A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie.
__label__1,very disappointing: The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all.
__label__1,Sandler Strikes Out: 8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot on the other hand while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result while it's probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running.
__label__1,Not the worst but far from good: This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book "The 50 worst films of all time". It is definently not one of those but one can hardly call it a proper film either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos and better than some of those!
__label__2,It Rises above the "Fluff" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on "emotional states" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic.
__label__2,Itten The Elements of Color: I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition. I would have rated it in Excellent condition rather than very good. I would like to thank the person who made it possible but have misplaced her name and address.
__label__2,Good follow-up to El Cielo.: A bit of a change this time for Dredg less progressive material more straight ahead rock tunes. I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms. But still this is the direction they chose to go in and it's definitely a very good one.
__label__1,Low class effort by High Class Band: This material represents why the 80's died the music is bland and poppy the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.
__label__2,Good Quality Cell Phone Holder: Contrary to other review I found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever.
__label__2,Loved it!: I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
__label__2,Charlie Brown Christmas was a Great Christmas Gift!: I gave this movie to a co-worker who loves all the Charlie Brown classics that are shown on TV. She was thrilled when she opened it!
__label__2,I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! "They don't know entertainment" as Krusty would say: I do love "Charlie Brown's Christmas" a joy for the entire family young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because "Charlie Brown's Christmas" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!
__label__2,Charlie Brown Christmas: One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.
__label__2,Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - "Sparky" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and in true Peanuts' style is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.
__label__2,great Christmas gift: This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift. I bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
__label__2,Yahoo for Charlie Brown: Being able to watch something like A Charlie Brown Christmas whenever I want is so soothing to the soul. Especially since I get really busy around the holidays and can't always catch it on TV.
__label__2,Classic: Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas. It was nice to watch a classic movie that I grew up watching as a kid myself with her as well as with my hubby. The Peanuts gang is classic and simple. Love them!
__label__1,Not a real Rammstein album.: Bootleg collection of b-sides remixes and singles. Really why even bother?
__label__1,After a few months- broken: This charger worked fine for a few months but now charges so slowly that using the computer while it's charging drains the battery. Very frustrating. Very poor quality.
__label__2,Works great and half the price: This AC adapter works great for me with my Apple 15" Aluminum G4 Powerbook. Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad it was a nice touch).
__label__2,Quite Satisfactory: This product works well with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original but once again that's a mere quibble. All in all I am satisfied with this purchase.
__label__2,Great product at a great price: A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended.
__label__2,Excellent Item!: I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple's charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You'll not regret it.
__label__1,Off and on: Its hard to find these types of chargers since Mac switched to the magnetic type. Its hit and miss with the working. My battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
__label__1,Cheap Doesn't charge dangerous power cord: This is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around. I own a 15" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the "brick" as it's plugged in you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.
__label__2,So much better than the apple version!: I love it it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot! It's wonderful!
__label__2,Good product at reasonable price: Though the output of this power supply is lower than the Apple supply it seems to work fine--and it is very reasonably priced. Too bad that Amazon stopped carrying the supply.
__label__1,If you're tempted to throw away $30....: I bought this charger near the end of May of this year and it stopped working about 2 weeks ago. It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14"). I have a brand new APPLE brand battery so I don't think it has anything to do with that or the computer. From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.
__label__1,Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4: This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4 but it does NOT.This plug looks fine but despite what the product description stats it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4 which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned.
__label__2,Another Binchy Great: This book takes a typical family examines its seperate members and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding.
__label__2,TU VIDA JAMAS VOLVERA A SER LA MISMA: Despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritual; este libro no es para aquellas personas que le tienen miedo a la verdad; pero si te atrevez a leerlo te aseguro que tu vida jamas volvera a ser la misma.ATREVETE!!!
__label__2,Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of "playing with future" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull
__label__1,book only no jacks: I bought this book from Amazon in used condition but 'like new'. Little did I realize or even think about that it didn't come with the jacks and ball. Now I have to try to find the right size jacks (not jumbo ones) and a ball. I guess you get what you pay for!
__label__2,Thomas connector tracks: The Thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs. Sometimes when setting up a new design my 4 year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish. These pieces have helped with that problem.
__label__1,Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though "O please get over yourself". I didn't finish the book it was a waste of time.
__label__1,Not Very good: I dont advise buying this grider it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper.
__label__1,Cannot adjust for coarseness: The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders. We replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn't work. Disappointing.
__label__2,Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven and are written in a 3:6 ratio meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool but as entertainment it falls a little short.
__label__2,My Girl Likes It: My two and half years old girl likes it so much and every I want to allure her to bed to sleep I will say read I Spy in bed.
__label__2,Still a great book: The Winds of light books are great! This one is no exception but I like the first 6 the best. The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is because the other 6 were better. I would of gave it a 5 if I had not read the others.
__label__1,I could have spent my money better: This book did not move me at all. The plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallow; they do not seem like real people at all.
__label__2,Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies: Is that a monarch a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail.Children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start.
__label__2,Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton. But please don't wear them with sandals they aren't that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use...you know what I mean...thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers the white and colored part are thin stretchy and breathable flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose.
__label__2,I was there: I liked the way Butler filled in the history of the Queen Mary andQueen Elizabeth.He also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship. On page 92 second phargaph tells of a March1945 crossing . I was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimg.I still have my white tag and cabinwith number on D deck.To verify my memory I checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth charges.This tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the war.Many of these things where new to me and I was there.
__label__2,Course Book: Well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed. Just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
__label__2,Leadership Made Spiritual: Maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible. I have used this as a guide for my youth group's leadership program (highshcool juniors and seniors) and it has been perfect. This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
__label__2,Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's "Hungry Again" and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind) makes an entire album of great music instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's "I Still Miss Someone" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely "Will He Be Waiting For Me." This is bluegrass but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour I couldn't be happier. I'm 26 have been listening to her since I was little and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.
__label__2,Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child I grew up in Knoxville TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly's gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy's with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!
__label__1,Band saves CD: As usual Dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice. The musicians are the only good thing about this recording. She's attempting to sing country songs Bluegrass style and it doesn't work.
__label__2,Almost perfect CD: The only reason I am giving this CD 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is too short! Lhasa's voice is sultry sad and powerful. The music is haunting yet airy. Perfection!
__label__2,The Castle in the Attic: I would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book. I especially loved the Silver Knight and how he became friends with William. Go get this book!
__label__2,non stop adventure: This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!
__label__1,worst book in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life! I was forced to read it for school. It was complicated and very boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! Please don't waste your time and money to read this book!! Read something else!!
__label__2,excellent: Good price excellent design and shipped well.Would've been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving.
__label__2,Best witch book i've ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friendsand I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come.
__label__2,To many issues: The story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome but the game just has to many technical issues. I think they rushed to get it on the shelves ASAP. Tech problems are my only quirk with the game.
__label__1,Angel of darkness is correct: This game is the angel of darkness - THe control system is impossible - The menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage - I have played all the tomb raider games - This one is near to unplayable - This thing went straight to EBAY - save your money for something good - THE TR people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something - jeez - the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
__label__1,a terrible product: this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it. DON'T BUY IT SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A BETTER ONE. HOPEFULLY IN OTHER WORDS POOR DESIGN EXCUTED WITH SUB STANDARD PARTS.
__label__1,BUYER BEWARE: This is the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back. Can't believe Amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department. Take my advice and save your money!!!!!I would have given it no stars but didn't have that option. In my opinion it rates 00000 stars....
__label__1,Didactic melodrama: I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed since Huxley has the ability to write well even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy for instance) but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended.
__label__1,Software is Horrible!: This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.
__label__1,Biography of Wright and his works: Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of "executive summary" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
__label__2,The Top Ten List for Christians byJames W. Moore: A bit simplistic at times but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist). Would recommend itfor Contemporary Adult Sunday School classes or Bible studies.
__label__2,Live it: Still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome so has a good seal to it.
__label__1,elem diff e-q's: While the shipping was AMAZING the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems. The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out. It would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource w/o an instructor leading.
__label__2,This is really cool!: This is a really cool record to own. My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!
__label__1,Very Disappointing.: I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past.
__label__2,A carefully constructed read.: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's "How to get control of time and your life" which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.
__label__2,Almost perfect: Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more.
__label__1,Not Stainless: These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for.
__label__1,What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future.
__label__1,You get what you pay for.: I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set but it will have to do for now.
__label__1,junk!: Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws. You could build a better set with twigs. Skip it.
__label__2,fireplace tool set: Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
__label__1,Failed to Work: I was unable to get this game to work in Windows Vista. I inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
__label__2,Long Hot Summer: Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia.
__label__1,Boring ...: I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.
__label__1,Stuck With You: I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.
__label__2,None: Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed smiled and even got tears! A brand new favorite author.
__label__2,Witty and clever.: This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan.
__label__2,Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God's presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!
__label__1,Still yet to recieve: I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago. I've tried everything to track where they might be but no success!!!
__label__1,Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the "ON" button but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the "OFF" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement) but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer.
__label__1,Left me feeling wanting.........: Somehow if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing I wouldn't have bought it. He talks extensively about competition rigs rules etc. which I had no interest in. I have yet to see a gun rag writer talk honestly about guns. Ever see a bad review in ANY of the gun magazines?
__label__2,Gun Digest 1911 Review: This was purchased as a Christmas gift. Excellent tutorial and very entertaining. The detailed discriptions and the pictures were informative. I spoke with the recipient of the gift after Christmas and he agreed. I really appreciate Amazon's speedy service.
__label__1,THIS CD SUCKX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE AND IT REALLY SUCKED!!!!! IF SOMEONE IS ITNERESTED IN BUYING THIS DON'T IT'S A WATSE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!
__label__2,LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion: This CD has instrumental experimental Jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces. Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.
__label__2,CUT IT UP DEF: IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!! I HAVE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED FOR THIS CD FOR THE LONGEST. I HAVE FINALLY FOUND IT!!! NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT.
__label__1,I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.
__label__1,More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction) poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty) and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of "Billy the Kid" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.
__label__1,waste of time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The Squiggler fell apart at second use with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk! Do not waste your time on this sub-standard horribly designed and made product!!!!!
__label__2,CO alarm: Easy product to install. No fuss. Plug it in. It is out of sight behind a couch. I am satisfied.j.
__label__2,Easy as it can be.: I bought the First Alert CO600 for two reasons. I own a rental unit and California requires a carbon monoxide alarm in each one. The second reason is the price. I ordered this unit and had it delivered to my rental unit. The lady who rents from me is not mechanically inclined at all but she had no trouble with setting this up. She's completely happy California is happy and I'm happy.
__label__1,"THE ROCKETS RED GLARE" ???: This over-priced pain in "the sitting area" has an always-on glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug.
__label__2,Absolutely great tripod for movie camera: excellent and cheap...panning acts almost like the $400+ tripods for movie cameras...and the controls in the handle add to the convenience and control of "shaky" movement...sold...stable...tall...worth the price
__label__2,A written masterpiece: I first read this book in 1984/85 while in high school and I have bought copies for several friends in the last 15 years. I plan on giving this book as a gift to everyone for Xmas with a basket of white and yellow candles. I read this book at least 2 times a year for inspiration and guidance. Next to the Bible this book is a masterpiece unparalleled.
__label__1,Love Jerry and Dean just not this version: I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film however the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally it wasn't listed as a DVD-R but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection.
__label__2,Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings visual cues and subtitles.
__label__2,I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!: The cover blurb on this book says it all: "For office slaves Internet addicts and stressed-out students." (ha! I am all three) If you are like me and have looked at many a Yoga book but put them aside due to the difficult positions/instructions or the time involved but still want to feel better relax and also rejuivinate AS well as relieve the symptoms of the computer age then this is the book for you. A definate must-buy!
__label__2,An American Treasure: Charles Brown is an American treasure. His blues piano stylings are the perfect compliment to his unmistakable vocals. The selections on this cd are typical of the high quality music that CB has produced his entire life. Buy this cd. Buy any cd by Charles Brown. You won't regret it.
__label__1,not finding comfort in food: I have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively. However this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders but I just don't have a positive self-image. So if you're like me don't read this book. I couldn't relate to it. The title is misleading.
__label__2,Typical Thomas video all about James: THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.
__label__1,Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand "new" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged). I can't imagine using them for metal let alone most rubbers. Despite the very affordable price I would NOT have purchased this set for the above reasons.
__label__1,Dull and dirty: Well I don't usually write reviews but I feel the need with this product.1rst. They were caked with mud ...what's up with this?2nd. They are dullI guess they can be sharpened ..we'll see
